# AI & LLM Integration

This project is configured to work seamlessly with AI coding assistants (like Antigravity, GitHub Copilot, etc.) and Large Language Models.

## 1. Documentation Context (`llms.txt`)

The file [`llms.txt`](../llms.txt) at the root of the project follows the [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org/) specification. 
It serves as a vetted map for LLMs, pointing them to the most relevant documentation files to understand the project architecture, API, and deployment procedures.
